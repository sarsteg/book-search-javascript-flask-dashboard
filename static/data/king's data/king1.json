Readers have witnessed Holly\u2019s gradual transformation from a shy (but also brave and ethical) recluse in Mr. Mercedes to Bill Hodges\u2019s partner in Finders Keepers to a full-fledged, smart, and occasionally tough private detective in The Outsider. In King\u2019s new novel, Holly is on her own, and up against a pair of unimaginably depraved and brilliantly disguised adversaries. When Penny Dahl calls the Finders Keepers detective agency hoping for help locating her missing daughter, Holly is reluctant to accept the case. Her partner, Pete, has Covid. Her (very complicated) mother has just died. And Holly is meant to be on leave. But something in Penny Dahl\u2019s desperate voice makes it impossible for Holly to turn her down. Mere blocks from where Bonnie Dahl disappeared live Professors Rodney and Emily Harris. They are the picture of bourgeois respectability: married octogenarians, devoted to each other, and semi-retired lifelong academics. But they are harboring an unholy secret in the basement of their well-kept, book-lined home, one that may be related to Bonnie\u2019s disappearance. And it will prove nearly impossible to discover what they are up to: they are savvy, they are patient, and they are ruthless. Holly must summon all her formidable talents to outthink and outmaneuver the shockingly twisted professors in this chilling new masterwork from Stephen King. \u201cI could never let Holly Gibney go. She was supposed to be a walk-on character in Mr. Mercedes and she just kind of stole the book and stole my heart.

King, a riveting, extraordinarily eerie, and moving story about a man whose mysterious affliction brings a small town together\u2014a timely, upbeat tale about finding common ground despite deep-rooted differences. Although Scott Carey doesn\u2019t look any different, he\u2019s been steadily losing weight. There are a couple of other odd things, too. He weighs the same in his clothes and out of them, no matter how heavy they are. Scott doesn\u2019t want to be poked and prodded. He mostly just wants someone else to know, and he trusts Doctor Bob Ellis. In the small town of Castle Rock, the setting of many of King\u2019s most iconic stories, Scott is engaged in a low grade\u2014but escalating\u2014battle with the lesbians next door whose dog regularly drops his business on Scott\u2019s lawn. One of the women is friendly; the other, cold as ice. Both are trying to launch a new restaurant, but the people of Castle Rock want no part of a gay married couple, and the place is in trouble. When Scott finally understands the prejudices they face\u2013including his own\u2014he tries to help. Unlikely alliances, the annual foot race, and the mystery of Scott\u2019s affliction bring out the best in people who have indulged the worst in themselves and others.
